Tk::Workspace.pm, Version 1.53, installation:

The Tk::Workspace.pm distribution has been tested only on the Linux
and Solaris operating systems.  Refer all questions and problem
reports to the author, rkiesling@mainmatter.com.


System Requirements:

1.  A Unix or derivative operating system.
2.  Perl version 5.005 or greater.
3.  Perl/Tk, version 800.022 or later.
4.  GNU make.


Installation:

1.  Untar the workspace-1.53 archive with the guzip and tar commands:

  # gzip -dc Workspace-1.53.tar.gz | tar xvf -
 
   or, using GNU tar,

  # tar zxvf Workspace-1.53.tar.gz

2.  Change to the top-level subdirectory:

  # cd workspace-1.53

3.  The top-level Makefile should work on any Unix or derivative
    system that has GNU make installed.  It uses the Perl ExtUtils 
    installation to build the package's Makefile.  At the prompt, 
    type:

  # perl Makefile.PL

4.  Build the program modules and documentation.  Type:

  # make

5.  If necessary, become root (via "su", for example), and 
    install the source files and documentation in the system's 
    site_perl library.

  # su
  Enter Password:
  $ make install

6.  Install the 'mkws' and 'upgrade' programs somewhere 
    convenient, like /usr/local/bin, and copy the
    'upgrade.man' file to '/usr/local/man/man1/upgrade.1'.  

7.  Optionally, install the workspace.xbm icon where
    the window manager can locate it, and set it as 
    the default icon resource.
