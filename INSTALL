Tk::Workspace.pm, Version 1.48, installation:

The Tk::Workspace.pm distribution has been tested only on the Linux
and Solaris operating systems.  Refer all questions and problem
reports to the author, rkiesling@mainmatter.com.


System Requirements:

1.  A Unix or derivative operating system.
2.  Perl version 5.005 or greater.
3.  Perl/Tk, version 800.022 or later.
4.  GNU make.


Installation:

1.  Untar the workspace-1.48 archive with the guzip and tar commands:

  # gzip -dc workspace-1.48.tar.gz | tar xvf -
 
   or, using GNU tar,

  # tar zxvf workspace-1.48.tar.gz

2.  Change to the top-level subdirectory:

  # cd workspace-1.48

3.  The top-level Makefile should work on any Unix or derivative
    system.  It uses the Perl ExtUtils installation to 
    build the package's Makefile.  At the prompt, type:

  # perl Makefile.PL

4.  Build the program modules and documentation.  Type:

  # make

5.  If necessary, become root (via "su", for example), and 
    install the source files and documentation in the system's 
    site_perl library, and the "mkws" script in 
    /usr/local/bin, using the "make install" command:

  # su
  Enter Password:
  $ make install
