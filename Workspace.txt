NAME
    Workspace.pm -- Library to create and use a persistent, embedded Perl
    workspace (file browser, shell, editor) script using Perl/Tk.

SYNOPSIS
       # Create a workspace from the shell prompt:

         #mkws "workspace"

       # Open an existing workspace:

         #./workspace &

       # In a Perl script:

          use Tk::Workspace;

          Tk::Workspace::open(Tk::Workspace::create("workspace"));

DESCRIPTION
    Workspace uses the Tk::TextUndo widget to create an embedded Perl text
    editor. The resulting file can be run as a standalone program.

MENU FUNCTIONS
    A workspace contains a menu bar with File, Edit, Options, and Help
    menus.

    The menus also pop up by pressing the right mouse button (Button-3) over
    the text area, whether the menu bar is visible or not.

    The menu functions are provided by the Tk::Workspace, Tk::TextUndo,
    Tk::Text, and Tk::Widget modules.

  File Menu

    Import Text -- Insert the contents of a selected text file at the
    insertion point.

    Export Text -- Write the contents of the workspace to a text file.

    System Command -- Prompts for the name of a command to be executed by
    the shell, /bin/sh. The output is inserted into the workspace.

    For example, to insert a manual page into the workspace, enter:

       man <programname> | colcrt - | col -b

    Shell -- Starts an interactive shell. The prompt is the PS1 prompt of
    the environment where the workspace was started. At present the
    workspace shell recognizes only a subset of the bash prompt variables,
    and does not implement command history or setting of environment
    variables in the subshell. Refer to the bash(1) manual page for further
    information.

    Typing 'exit' leaves the shell and returns the workspace to normal text
    editing mode.

    Save -- Save the workspace to disk.

    Quit -- Close the workspace window, optionally saving to disk.

  Edit Menu

    Undo -- Reverse the next previous change to the text.

    Cut -- Delete the selected text and place it on the X clipboard.

    Copy -- Copy the selected text to the X clipboard.

    Paste -- Insert text from the X clipboard at the insertion point.

    Evaluate Selection -- Interpret the selected text as Perl code.

    Find -- Search for specified text, and specify search options. Marks
    text for later replacement (see below).

    Find Next -- Find next match of search text.

    Previous -- Find previous match of search text.

    Replace -- Replace marked search text with text from the replacement
    entry.

    Goto Line -- Go to the line entered by the user.

    Which Line -- Report the line and column position of the insertion
    point.

  Options Menu

    Wrap -- Select how the text should wrap at the right margin.

    Scroll Bars -- Select from scroll bars at right or left, top or bottom
    of the text area.

    Show/Hide Menubar -- Toggle whether the menubar is visible. A popup
    version of the menus is always available by pressing the right mouse
    button (Button 3) over the text area.

    Foreground Color -- Select foreground and insertion cursor color from
    list of system colors.

    Background Color -- Select text window background color from list of
    system colors.

    Text Font -- Select text font from list of system fonts.

  Help Menu

    About -- Report name of workspace and modification time, and version of
    Workspace.pm library.

    Help -- Display the Workspace.pm POD documentation in a text window
    formatted by pod2text.

METHODS
    There is no actual API specification, but Workspaces recognize the
    following instance methods:

    about, create, new, bind, window, text, name, textfont, foreground,
    background, filemenu, editmenu, wrap, parent_ws, width, height, x, y,
    open, ws_font, ws_setcolor, ws_quit, write_to_disk, menubar, ws_close,
    ws_copy, ws_cut, ws_paste, ws_undo, self_help, ws_import, ws_export.

    The following class methods are available:

    WrapMenuItems, ScrollMenuItems.

    The only method that recognizes configuration options is the
    constructor, 'new'. At the moment it the only option it recognizes is
    'menubar', which sets a visible (true) or hidden (false) menubar.
